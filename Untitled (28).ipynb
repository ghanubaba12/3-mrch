    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "ans-Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting websites and applications on the internet. The main difference between them lies in how the resources and infrastructure are managed and allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Allocation: In traditional web hosting, websites or applications are hosted on a single physical server that is owned, operated, and maintained by a hosting provider. The resources of that server, such as CPU, RAM, and storage, are dedicated solely to that specific website or application. In contrast, cloud hosting utilizes a network of virtual servers that are interconnected and work together to host websites or applications. Resources can be dynamically allocated and scaled up or down based on the needs of the website or application, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Traditional web hosting typically has limited scalability, as it relies on the resources of a single physical server. If the website or application experiences increased traffic or resource demands, it may result in performance issues or downtime. On the other hand, cloud hosting offers greater scalability as it can allocate additional resources or virtual servers to handle increased traffic or resource requirements, ensuring better performance and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Structure: Traditional web hosting usually involves fixed costs, where you pay for a predefined amount of resources regardless of whether you fully utilize them or not. In contrast, cloud hosting often follows a pay-as-you-go or usage-based pricing model, where you only pay for the resources you actually use. This allows for more cost-effective hosting, as you can scale resources up or down as needed, avoiding over-provisioning or underutilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redundancy and Reliability: Cloud hosting typically offers higher redundancy and reliability compared to traditional web hosting. Cloud hosting providers often have multiple data centers in different geographical locations, allowing for redundant copies of your website or application to be stored in multiple locations. This helps to ensure that your website or application remains available even in the event of hardware failures or other issues at one data center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management and Control: Traditional web hosting often requires manual configuration and management of the hosting environment, including server setup, software installations, and maintenance tasks. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, provides more automation and self-service capabilities through web-based interfaces or APIs, allowing you to easily manage and control your hosting environment, deploy applications, and monitor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while traditional web hosting relies on a single physical server and has limited scalability, cloud hosting utilizes a network of virtual servers, offers greater scalability, flexibility, cost-efficiency, redundancy, and provides more automated management and control options.\n",
